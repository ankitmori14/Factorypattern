# Factorypattern
Factory method is a creational design pattern. which solves the problem of creating concreteless objects.
Define interface/Abstract class for creating object but let subclass decide which class to instantiate.


Background
 

Before learning Factory Method Pattern, I just want to share a little about "Gang of Four (GoF)" to which the Factory Method pattern belongs.

Who are the Gang of Four?

The Gang of Four are the authors of the book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". This important book describes various development techniques and pitfalls in addition to providing 23 object-oriented programming design patterns. The four authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.
